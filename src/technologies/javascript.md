<p>We believe <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the best tool for getting our clients to solutions as quickly as possible. It allows us to build the best future-forward applications that scale with the modern web. Why? Well, tons of large tech companies support and use JavaScript, like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Accenture, and many others. It’s fast, agile, and has a robust ecosystem and network of support. By focusing on mastering JavaScript, we’re also able to move efficiently into related technologies like <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.</p>
