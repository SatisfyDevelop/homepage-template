<p class="paragraph--major">The leaders of various nonprofit and community groups in Boston had trouble communicating events to their target demographic and potential volunteers. There were no centralized channels for discovery of new events and reaching new audiences. Each organization relied on individual marketing efforts, making it difficult for volunteers and the broader public to find relevant events and resources. With all the emails lists and independent forums trying to achieve the same goal, it became clear that there had a to be a central hub to tackle this problem. East Coast Product partnered with a City of Boston community initiative led by City Awake and the Timothy Smith Network (TSN) to build out a Social Impact Calendar, an app that serves to connect the people of Boston, especially black and latino youth with community events and services.</p>

<p>Through the design sprint, we learned that users were more likely to use search engines over going directly to aggregate event sites. To address this, we used Isomorphic React to improve the siteâ€™s SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Design Sprint</h1>

<p>To determine the most efficient way to tackle these challenges, East Coast Product ran a design sprint with the leaders of the Timothy Smith Network and City Awake. The goal of the sprint was to discover what features both event organizers and target attendees would require discover new events and services. The East Coast Product team built a calendar platform that would not only display event information in an attractive way, but would be easy and intuitive to use.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Building for the Users</h1>

<p>The Social Impact Calendar would go on to serve dozens of nonprofits and thousands of users that are looking to connect with those nonprofits. Building a user experience that would satisfy the needs of all the nonprofits was absolutely vital.</p>
