<p class="paragraph--major">You visit a hotel, pull out your phone, and attempt to connect to the internet. After a few quick taps, you’re connected. Seems simple enough, right?</p>

<p class="paragraph--major">In those simple steps are  a number of moving parts are all coming together to ensure you’re connected to the internet as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is what Safety NetAccess (SNA) specializes in, serving hotels like Hilton and Marriott worldwide. SNA collaborated with East Coast Product to combine and expand the functionality of three different iterations of SNAP into a future-proof SaaS platform called SNAPx.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Discovery</h1>

<p>We design interfaces with users in mind and SNAPx is no different. Utilizing the design sprint methodology, we got to work understanding the multitude of different ways users engage with SNAP to rethink and optimize their experience for SNAPx. Through the power of intensive user interviews and prototype testing, we understood exactly what needed to be built.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Eliminate the Help Desk</h1>

<p>Our goal for the SNAPx was to eliminate the need for a help desk by providing even the most complex user with an effortless user experience. With such a variety of different users, with such varied backgrounds and tech expertise; the platform had to be as simple yet detailed as possible to fit the needs of the different users.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Building for Scale</h1>

<p>Rebuilding the platform so it’s built to scale gave SNA a brand new vertical for sales: its competitors. SNA can now license out the platform to other companies that operate in similar areas.. Not only can they provide a world-class wifi experience to customers like Hilton and Marriott, SNA can begin generating revenue from companies seeking to license the SNAPx technology.</p>
