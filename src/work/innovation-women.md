<p class="paragraph--major">Innovation Women set out to solve the glaring problem of male-dominated panels at technical and entrepreneurial events. With a tight deadline but no tech team, Bobbie Carlton, founder of Innovation Women, approached East Coast Product to build out her dream. We worked closely with the Innovation Women team to fully understand the business plan and vision before diving directly into development. Working fast and staying agile through the development process was critical to the successful completion of the application. Together, we were able to beat the deadline with enough extra time to further test market fit and ensure all of the necessary features.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">MVP Development</h1>

<p>We needed to ensure the feature set we were building was the feature set that users would both want and need. Performing a deep dive on the platform and the potential users helped us outline exactly what we needed to build.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Transparency</h1>

<p>Bobbie Carlton and the her team at innovation women were not technology savvy. To address this and make them feel connected to the process we fostered completely transparent communication channels throughout the entire development cycle.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Ruby on Rails</h1>

<p>With a tight deadline, we had to work with the existing code base which was built primarily Ruby on Rails, a language that was out of our tech wheelhouse. By running lean, we had enough time to build the application all while training our staff to get up to speed on Ruby.</p>
