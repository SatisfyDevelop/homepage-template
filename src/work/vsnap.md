<p class="paragraph--major">Vsnap is a SaaS video messaging platform for inside sales. The app humanizes sales interactions to build sustained business relationships. As Vsnap grew and the user-base was more defined, it became clearer to CEO, Dave McLaughlin, that the prototype application in its current state was not scalable. In December 2013, he brought in Chris Swenor as CTO and the East Coast Product development team to rethink the app. After three months, the application was completely rebuilt in JavaScript and successfully re-launched on schedule. The rebuild resulted in the successful acquisition of Vsnap in April 2015.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">Node.js</h1>

<p>The team evaluated various languages and decided that the most performant choice was JavaScript. Selecting a popular, future-proof language, meant that it would be easier to hire developers down the line and ensure an abundant community of resources and support for further product development. The frontend was built in Angular.js and the backend was built in Node.js. </p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">API-First Development</h1>

<p>API-first development is a development methodology that focuses on building an API (Application program interface) first that includes the bulk of the application logic and then build an application to consume that API. By developing in this style developers are able to create mobile and web apps connected to the same logic more efficiently.</p>
